Serious business
Objectives

    Learn how to use if statements and combine them

- Instructions

    Create a simple html page
    Add some styling so it looks good
    Add two columns:
        One column has a table containing the business hours of a company (just pick some random business hours)
        The second column has a simple paragraph, containing a phrase declaring the business currently open / closed.

- So basically:

    When you load the page:
        Check the day
        Check the time
        Compare it to the business hours
        Declare if the business is open

- BONUS Objective

    Add a live updating clock of the current time (digital)
    Add a button "Close early"
    When you click this button, the current day's business hours end at the current time in the table (So on thursday if I click this button at 14:45, the table's business hours for thursday will change to end at 14:45)
